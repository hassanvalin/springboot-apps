#  ########### Using Volumes ############################

- templates/pv.yaml

Persistent volume has been created

- templates/pvc.yaml

Persistent volume claim has been created

- templates/mysql-deploy-svc.yaml

Mysql DB has been created and exposed the port with service


-  If you want to apply through kubectl you can generate yaml files using 'helm template .' that gives you all yaml files, naming it as test2.yaml

. Created a namespace helm-ns1 and applied the file using 'kubectl apply -f test2.yaml' that creates all below kubernetes objects

persistentvolume/my-first-app-pv created
persistentvolumeclaim/my-first-app-pvc created
service/mysql-deployment created
deployment.apps/mysql-deployment created


. You can see pv and pvc created using command 'kubectl get pv'

. Check deployments, pods, svc using below kubectl commands

kubectl get deployments -n helm-ns1
kubectl get pods -n helm-ns1
kubectl get svc -n helm-ns1


. If you want to verify by connecting to the mysql DB that created use below sample command that connects to your DB

kubectl run -it --rm --image=mysql:5.7 --restart=Never -n helm-ns1 mysql-client -- mysql -h <your_svc_name> -psecretpwd


If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

mysql> create database mydb;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> use mydb;
Database changed

mysql> create table mytable(name varchar(20), age varchar(15));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> select * from mytable;
Empty set (0.01 sec)


. Even if you delete the pod and recreate a new one that data will be available in DB because of volumes
